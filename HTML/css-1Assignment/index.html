    <h3>HISTORY</h3>  <hr>
    <p>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907[a] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic Indian revolutionary[6] 
        who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[7] in what was to be 
        retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[8] He later took part in a largely symbolic 
        bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the 
        back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, 
        and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[9] Borrowing ideas from 
        Bolshevism and anarchism,[10][11][12][13][14] he electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, 
        and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful 
        campaign for India's independence.[15]</p>
        <p>In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, 
            both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist 
            Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police
             officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, 
             who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom
              they had intended to assassinate.[16] They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular 
              Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai 
              was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on
               a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman.[17][18]
                As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight
                 bullet wounds.[19] Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh,
             who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.[17][18]</p>

    <h3>Eary Life</h3> <hr>
    <p>Bhagat Singh was born on 27 September 1907[a] in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu.[23] Bhagat Singh's father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915.[23]</p>
    <p>After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore.[23] In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.[23]</p>
    <p>Police became concerned with Singh's influence on youths and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest.[24] He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar[25] and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British.[26] He also wrote for Kirti, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party ("Workers and Peasants Party") and briefly for the Veer Arjun newspaper, published in Delhi.[27][b] He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.[29]</p>
